## With More Time
- Implement **server-side sorting** by field and increase the page size.
- Make columns resizable and **keep headers sticky** to make the table easier to read.
- Configure the query to **stash previous data** and remove `{isFetching ...}` to **stabilize table content during fetches**.
- Implement **gradient (shimmer) loading states** for table rows/cells to reduce layout shift.
- Add **infinite scroll pagination** for a smoother experience when browsing large datasets.
- Create **database indexes** on the most frequently searched fields to make lookups faster.
- Refine **responsive design** so the table works just as well on mobile and tablets.
- **Rework specialty cells** to use wrap-friendly tags and remove scroll containers.
- Add **frontend and backend tests** to ensure stability and catch regressions early.

I really enjoyed working on this! Thank you for the opportunity to be in conversation with you.
